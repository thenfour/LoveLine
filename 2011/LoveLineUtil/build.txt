with the multithreaded DLL C-runtime library. To accomplish this, make 
the following settings under Settings of the Project menu: 

- C/C++ / Code Generation / Use run-time library should be set to 
  Multithreaded-DLL (either Debug or not). 
- Link / General / Ignore all default libraries should be on. 
- Link / General / Object/library modules should include Msvcrt.lib 
  (or Msvcrtd.lib), wmstub.lib, and Wmvcore.lib. It should not include Libc.lib 
  or any variation.
